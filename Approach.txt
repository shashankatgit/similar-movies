At the first glance it is evident that the most important parameter of similarity check is Genre. 

But, only genre is not enough for finding 10 similar movies. There have to be several other parameters.
So, I decided to give weights to each of the parameter which holds some importance as can be seen in the python source. The weights help in calculating a score for each movie with respect to the base movie. This will help us sort out the 10 most similar movies from the lot.

I also thought of extracting keywords from the description given using RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction). After plugging and using it I realized that there is not much deviation in results even after keywords are taken into consideration. So, the initial fundamental approach was also good to go.

There are two source and output json files. One is produced with keyword extraction and the other is without it.
